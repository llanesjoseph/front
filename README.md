# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Pushing to GitHub

To get your code into a GitHub repository, you'll need to use the `git` command-line tool from your local computer. Here are the steps:

1.  **Download your project code** from Firebase Studio to your local machine and unzip it.

2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt** and navigate into your project's directory.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

3.  **Initialize a new Git repository:**
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    ```

4.  **Add your files to be tracked by Git:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

5.  **Commit your files:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

6.  **Link your local repository to the remote one on GitHub.** Make sure to replace the URL with your own repository's URL.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/llanesjoseph/front.git
    ```

7.  **Push your code to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After following these steps on your computer, your code will be on GitHub.
